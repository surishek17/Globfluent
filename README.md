# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Step-by-Step Guide:

Step 1: Install the node package manager using following command
# npm install

Step 2: Run the Application:
Start the development server.

# npm run dev

The application should now be running on http://localhost:5173 (or a similar port). Open this URL in your browser to see the quiz application in action.
